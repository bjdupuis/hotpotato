/**
 * Pipelining implementation of {@link HttpConnection} interface.
 * <p/>
 * This version accepts up N idempotent HTTP 1.1 operations. Should an error occur during the execution of the pipelined
 * requests, <strong>all</strong> the currently pipelined requests will fail - and will <strong>not</strong> be
 * retried.
 * <p/>
 * This version can yield faster throughput than {@link DefaultHttpConnection} implementation for bursts up to N
 * requests of idempotent HTTP 1.1 operations, since it will batch requests and receive batch responses, potentially
 * taking advantage of being able to fit several HTTP requests in the same TCP frame.
 * <p/>
 * When the limit of pipelined requests is hit, this connection presents the same behavior as {@link
 * DefaultHttpConnection} - it starts returning {@code false} on {@code isAvailable()} and immediately failing any
 * requests that are submitted while {@code isAvailable()} would return {@code false}.
 * <p/>
 * Please note that if a connection to a host is likely to have all types of HTTP operations mixed (PUT, GET, POST, etc)
 * or also requests with version 1.0, this connection will not present any advantage over the default non-pipelining
 * implementation. Since it contains more complex logic, it will potentially be a little bit slower.
 * <p/>
 * Use this implementation when you know beforehand that you'll be performing mostly idempotent HTTP 1.1 operations.
